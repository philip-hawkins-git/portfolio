# The Cyclistic Ride Share: Case Study
This notebook is part of the Capstone Case Study Project for Google's Data Analytics Certificate course. It utilizes the capabilities of R and Google Colab to streamline the data analysis workflow from start to finish.

In this hypothetical scenario, I am a junior data analyst working with the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. Lily Moreno, the director of marketing, believes that the company's future success hinges on maximizing the number of annual memberships. To achieve this, my team will analyze the differences in how annual members and casual non-members use Cyclistic bikes. These insights will inform a new marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. However, before implementing the strategy, Cyclistic executives must approve the recommendations, which requires compelling data insights and professional data visualizations. I contend that the data will demonstrate annual members and casual non-members have distinct consumer profiles that should necessitate a distinct marketing strategy.

# Tableau Presentation

While R + Colab is great for exploration, it isn't the best for aesthetics. That's why I created a Tableau dashboard to present my findings in a more condensed and visually appealing manner. Take a look.
